> An open-source floating timer with image support

A minimal timer designed to stay out of your way. Set a duration with the slider
or by typing minutes. You can also show an image in the floating timer, either
as a gentle companion for focus or a simple visual reminder.

## Features

- Floating timer: Dzenn can pin a compact always-on-top timer window so countdown progress stays visible without keeping the main window open.
- 3 display modes: the floating window supports `timer only`, `image with timer`, and `image only`, with layout switching handled at runtime.
- Quick presets: menu bar presets let you jump to commonly used focus durations instantly, then start a session without opening full settings.
- Completion sound customization: you can choose the alert sound used when a session finishes and control playback behavior through app settings.
- Floating opacity control: the floating window appearance supports adjustable opacity so it can stay visible but less intrusive over other apps.
- Image positioning: when using image layouts, image offset controls let you fine-tune placement so composition remains readable with timer overlay.
